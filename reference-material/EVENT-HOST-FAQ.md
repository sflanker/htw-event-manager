# Event Host FAQ

## What is Honolulu Tech Week?  
Honolulu Tech Week (HTW) is a week of inspiring events hosted by companies and leaders connected to Hawaii’s tech ecosystem. HTW is an “unconference”, an action-packed week of 50+ events across 20+ venues under the shared banner of Honolulu Tech Week. It’s a valuable opportunity to showcase the strength and vibrancy of our community — bringing together startups, key Hawaii industries, remote tech leaders, and the next generation of students. People connect across companies and sectors, gaining insights from top founders, engineers, executives, investors, and policymakers. Inspired by tech weeks in SF and MIA, HTW highlights Hawaii’s tech, talent, capital, and adoption against the stunning backdrop of Honolulu.

## What are the benefits of hosting an event during Honolulu Tech Week?  
Event Hosts grow their audience, brand, and business while contributing to the growth of Hawaii’s tech community, ecosystem, and economy. They receive brand awareness and discovery via placement on the official HTW calendar (10,000+ views), co-marketing of your event across HTW’s tech-forward community and socials (2,500+ people), and event planning advice. In addition to gaining audience and giving back, common reasons to host include:

* Bring together your team, customers, partners, and investors while meeting new ones.  
* Educate, meet, recruit, and retain key tech talent, users, stakeholders, and more.  
* Drive awareness for your brand, product, service, new initiatives, and announcements.

## Are there speaking opportunities for me or my company?  
We do not have a general speaker program like a conference — the best way to promote your speakers is by hosting or co-hosting your own event\!

## How big of an event should I host?   
In 2024, small events (10-20 attendees) to the largest ones (300+ attendees) alike were able to create value and generate an average rating of 4.7/5 stars. While some events are attended by hundreds of people, smaller and intimate events are awesome too. Quality is what counts\!

## Do I have to pay a fee to place my event on the calendar?  
No. We encourage event hosts to use their resources to invest into their amazing events. 

## Can my company participate or host an event if we're not based in Hawaii?  
Yes\! We love learning from leaders globally, but emphasize that companies and leaders should have a connection to Hawaii’s community, ecosystem, or economy. Examples include those with employees or customers in Hawaii, returning kama’aina, or strong ties e.g. friends, investors.

## As an Event Host, what am I responsible for and what is HTW responsible for? 

* As an event host, you are responsible for coming up with your event idea, organizing the event, covering all costs, and marketing it. The HTW team will help with event guidance, promotion, and co-marketing, but hosts are responsible for the success of their events.
* If you become an Event Host, we drive visibility to your event by placing it on the official HTW calendar and help to co-promote via our social media channels and across our community. You also get access to the official HTW logo and branding. 

## Why and how does HTW screen events?  
We screen events for quality of theme, companies, speakers, and impact because each event reflects on the overall ecosystem. Given HTW is once per year, we love events that are unique and special. Event hosts’ ability to promote to an existing audience and having a track record of success is desired. If we feel an area could be improved, we help with advice and guidance.

## Why not Hawaii Tech Week?  
Our primary focus is Honolulu to create a density of people and events. This makes it more accessible to attend multiple events and increases attendance for Event Hosts, although some events are hosted outside of Honolulu. A single week concentrated in Honolulu gives those visiting from outer islands, returning kama’aina, and tech hubs globally, the flexibility to travel and attend events and work remotely, visit family and friends, and experience Oahu.

## If attendees sign up free for HTW, can I host a paid event as an Event Host?  
Yes, but there are trade-offs we outline below. As part of HTW’s commitment to the future generations of Hawaii, we ask Event Hosts with paid events to provide student tickets free. 

## What is the role of sponsors and partners versus event hosts?  
Running HTW requires material upfront and ongoing investment to sustain. It is made possible by the support of our cash sponsors who both host their own individual events, AND, help fund special events and operations e.g. keynotes, videography, and marketing, etc, that benefits all attendees and hosts. In turn, we provide them with special branding on the website, event promotion, and benefits like venue space. Partners e.g. travel providers provide services and special discounts across the larger base of attendees and hosts.

## Who founded and organizes Tech Week?   
Aloha, I’m [Michael](https://linktr.ee/michaelhawaii). Born and raised in Honolulu, I spent a decade in the Bay Area helping build VC backed startups and leading a nonprofit dedicated to bridging Hawaii & NorCal. I founded and seeded HTW to unify our broader tech ecosystem and build bridges with those connected to it globally. I’m grateful to be joined by an awesome group of sponsors, ambassadors, and volunteers. The team’s role is to streamline the process to plan events, drive event visibility and promotion, host broader events for the community, and grow the ecosystem.
